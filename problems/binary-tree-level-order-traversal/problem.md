# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

## Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
