# Next smaller palindrome number

Given a number, find the next smallest palindrome larger than this number. For example, if the input number is "2 3 5 4 5", the output should be "2 3 6 3 2". And if the input number is "9 9 9", the output should be "1 0 0 1".

The input is assumed to be an array. Every entry in array represents a digit in input number.

There can be three different types of inputs that need to be handled separately. 
1) The input number is palindrome and has all 9s. For example "9 9 9". Output should be "1 0 0 1" 
2) The input number is not palindrome. For example "1 2 3 4". Output should be "1 3 3 1" 
3) The input number is palindrome and doesn’t have all 9s. For example "1 2 2 1". Output should be "1 3 3 1".
