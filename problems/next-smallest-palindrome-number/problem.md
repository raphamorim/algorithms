# Next smaller palindrome number

Given a number, find the next smallest palindrome larger than this number. For example, if the input number is `2 3 5 4 5`, the output should be `2 3 6 3 2`. And if the input number is `9 9 9`, the output should be `1 0 0 1`.

The input is assumed to be an array. Every entry in array represents a digit in input number.

There can be three different types of inputs that need to be handled separately. 

- The input number is palindrome and has all 9s. For example `9 9 9`. Output should be `1 0 0 1` 
- The input number is not palindrome. For example `1 2 3 4`. Output should be `1 3 3 1`
- The input number is palindrome and doesnâ€™t have all 9s. For example `1 2 2 1`. Output should be `1 3 3 1`.
